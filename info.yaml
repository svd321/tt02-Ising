# TinyTapeout project information
project:
  wokwi_id:  347224831508349523    # If using wokwi, set this to your project's ID
#  source_files:        # If using an HDL, set wokwi_id as 0 and uncomment and list your source files here. Source files must be in ./src
#    - counter.v
#    - decoder.v
#  top_module:  "seven_segment_seconds"      # put the name of your top module here, make it unique by prepending your github username

# As everyone will have access to all designs, try to make it easy for someone new to your design to know what
# it does and how to operate it.
#
# Here is an example: https://github.com/mattvenn/tinytapeout_m_segments/blob/main/info.yaml
#
# This info will be automatically collected and used to make a datasheet for the chip.

  author:       "Seppe Van Dyck"      # Your name
  title:        "Ising Spin"      # Project title
  description:  "Simulate a single spin in a 1D Ising model with 2 neighbours and an external field."      # Short description of what your project does
  how_it_works: "It runs the Metropolis-Hastings monte-carlo algorithm to simulate an Ising spin in a linear chain with two neighbours and an external field."      # Longer description of how the project works
  how_to_test:  "Disable field and make the neighbours unequal, now the spin will flip every clock cycle."      # Instructions on how someone could test your project, include things like what buttons do what and how to set the clock if needed
  external_hw:  ""      # Describe any external hardware needed
  language:     "wokwi" # other examples include Verilog, Amaranth, VHDL, etc
  doc_link:     ""      # URL to longer form documentation, eg the README.md in your repository
  clock_hz:     2       # Clock frequency in Hz (if required)
