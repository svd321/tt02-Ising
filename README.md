# What is this project about?

This project implements a monte-carlo simulation of a single spin of a 1D [Ising model](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ising_model).
The steps of the Metropolis-Hastings alogrithm are run on-chip, so no external random numbers or lookup tables are needed. 
All parameters, programming the environment (neighbour spins, coupling constants and temperature) are input through the 8 inputs.
For more details on this particular implementation can be found in the accompanying paper (coming soon).

# What is Tiny Tapeout?

TinyTapeout is an educational project that aims to make it easier and cheaper than ever to get your digital designs manufactured on a real chip!

## How to change the Wokwi project

Edit the [info.yaml](info.yaml) and change the wokwi_id to match your project.

## How to enable the GitHub actions to build the ASIC files

Please see the instructions for:

* [Enabling GitHub Actions](https://tinytapeout.com/faq/#when-i-commit-my-change-the-gds-action-isnt-running)
* [Enabling GitHub Pages](https://tinytapeout.com/faq/#my-github-action-is-failing-on-the-pages-part)

## How does it work?

When you edit the info.yaml to choose a different ID, the [GitHub Action](.github/workflows/gds.yaml) will fetch the digital netlist of your design from Wokwi.

After that, the action uses the open source ASIC tool called [OpenLane](https://www.zerotoasiccourse.com/terminology/openlane/) to build the files needed to fabricate an ASIC.
